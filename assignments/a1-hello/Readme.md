Draws eyes with pupils that oscillate. 
I had really no issues with this program. I like the applications of oscillation, I feel like you can be very creative with it.

# Look

Draw eyes whose pupils follow the mouse when clicked.
It took me a bit to understand the trig but I've basically got it. It's not as smooth as the example gif but it's close.

# Many Particles

Create a bunch of linearily moving particles that wrap around the screen.
Mine obviously doesn't work. I've never worked with structs before so it took me a bit to understand how to approach it. I feel like my code got close to
what it needed to be? I don't know.

# Circles

Create rotating rings of circles.
I don't even want to talk about this one. I spent so much time trying to figure out what I did wrong and I just can't. It got to the
point where I don't even understand my own code anymore and I was randomly changing things to see what would happen.

# Unique

They're meant to be digletts from Pokemon but they look kind of funny. I had wanted to use more of the animation tools we learned this week
(for instance I wanted to create rocks at the base of the frame that sort of rumbled) but I ran out of time.
